# Signal Processing Projects

This directory contains standalone signal processing projects that can be developed independently.

## Project Categories

- Signal processing implementations
- Communication protocol projects
- Network programming tools
- Digital signal processing applications

## Getting Started

Each project in this directory should have its own README with:
- Project description
- Signal processing algorithms
- Setup instructions
- Dependencies
- Usage examples

## Development Guidelines

1. Use appropriate version control for each project
2. Include proper documentation
3. Follow signal processing best practices
4. Include test signals and expected outputs
5. Document signal processing algorithms and techniques
